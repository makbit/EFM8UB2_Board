### Example firmware for my **EFM8UB2 development board** based on [SiLbas 8-bit MCU](https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/8-bit).
> These simple projects can be used for tutorial purposes.
Required header files and libraries are stored in `inc` and `lib` folders.
Project files were created with the [Keil uVision C51](http://www.keil.com/c51/).
> Functions for initialization for the on-board perephirials are located in `board.c` file.
